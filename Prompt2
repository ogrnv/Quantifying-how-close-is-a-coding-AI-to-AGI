Please change TTSR() function in the following C program example.c to achieve the best test results i.e minimal number of moves in all tests.
See the definitions of moves, test... in the program.

It is necessary to exclude the occurrence of any software loops, for example, when a chip moves along a closed path due to a change in the TTSR() function.
