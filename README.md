If two or more AI or/and people are capable to write in given* (quantum) programming language(s) a code for solving of test tasks created using the algorithm described in FIRST-NB.html from https://github.com/ogrnv/random-intelligence-tests, then their intelligence can be compared by comparing test results obtained using software applications based on the codes.

\* as an option - without language restrictions.

A few notes:

Due to the inevitable leakage of the best AI algorithms into other AI systems, there may be cases when an AI, which itself codes weak algorithms, adopts the best algorithm and demonstrates a high, but false, level of intelligence.

The question arises on the admissibility of informing AIs about systematic errors in their algorithms. Because this will add human intelligence to the AI ​​testing results.<p><br>
